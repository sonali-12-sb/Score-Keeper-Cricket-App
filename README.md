# 📌 Score Keeper App: Cricket App  

This app was developed as part of the **Android Basics: User Input** course, a module in the **Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree** program.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Updating views dynamically  
- App is divided into two columns, one for each team.  
- Each column contains multiple buttons.  
- Each score button updates the score `TextView` in its column by adding the correct number of points.

- The layout contains a **Reset** button.  
- Properly scoping variables.

## 📱 Screens of the App  
The **Cricket App** is a **single-screen application** designed to track the scores of two competing teams.  
Users can view:  
✔ **Total scores** for Team A and Team B  
✔ **Number of players out**  
✔ **Total overs played**  

It features a **beautiful and visually appealing UI design**. The app's UI is **fully responsive**, adapting smoothly to various screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience across different devices.

Each button has functionality.  
✔ Tapping a button **adds points** to the team's score.  
✔ Users can **update the number of out players** and **total overs**.  
✔ After finishing the game, clicking the **Reset** button starts a new game with a fresh scoreboard.
